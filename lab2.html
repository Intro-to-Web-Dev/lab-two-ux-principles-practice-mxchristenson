                    <h3>Usabilty</h3>
                        <p>
                        I would recommend to make the footer a little bit more simple for the audience. 
                        I would also changed the spead of the main pictures and not have it flip to the same picture twice.  
                      </p>
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>I would make sure the coding lang is up to date to be able to br fully functioning. I would also 
                 add text to every image incase it gets broken, a lot of the image have no text with them.
                </p>
